## Clearing services tailored to turf upgrades

Before new turf goes down, the surface has to be clean, level, and free of stubborn materials. Our clearing crew handles every phase, coordinating dumpsters, equipment, and recycling so you only have to worry about the design that follows.

### What we take care of

- Old artificial turf and infill
- Old grass or weeds and root tangles
- Gravel pathways or rock beds
- Concrete pads, edging, and footings
- Other debris standing in the way of installation

### Safety-first approach

We mark utilities, protect nearby structures, and plan the haul-off route before any removal begins. Your property stays tidy and accessible, and the surface we deliver is primed for new turf, pavers, or any finish you choose next.

### Ready for the next crew

After clearing, we rough grade the area, compact loose soils, and provide notes on any drainage adjustments we recommend. Installers appreciate arriving to a predictable, debris-free job site—and you save time on project turnover.
