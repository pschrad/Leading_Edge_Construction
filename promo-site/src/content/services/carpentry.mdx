## Turf repair that keeps your surface game-ready

Wear happens, especially on fields, pet areas, and backyard play zones. Our turf repair team tackles seam failures, low infill patches, and fiber damage so you can skip the full replacement and get right back to enjoying your space.

### Typical repairs we handle

- Turf repair
- Seam separation and edge lifting
- Infill depletion and compaction
- High-traffic fiber damage
- Drainage issues causing surface ripples

### Preventing future problems

We do more than fix the visible damage. Our technicians evaluate the base, drainage, and traffic patterns to recommend maintenance or upgrades—keeping repairs from resurfacing.

### Post-repair grooming

Every visit ends with a groomed surface, refreshed infill, and a short checklist tailored to your turf system. You get a detailed report and photos so you can track the condition over time.
